#  Dependinator

Dependinator visualizes code structure and dependencies in a map-like interface to make it easier to understand and refactor the architecture. 
Dependinator also provides functionality to explore these dependencies and make it easy to jump from one part of the system to another and even 
dive into the code, inline, or open external code editor.
